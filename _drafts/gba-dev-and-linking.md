This is the second in a series of posts about developing a save-dumping utility for the Gameboy Advance.
Today we focus on the gritty details of moving code from ROM to RAM, and then executing it from there.
All code is targeting the GNU Assembler (`as`) in its default configuration, or the GNU Linker (`ld`).

Please see the second post in this series for background on the CPU target.

## The Toolchain

## Compiling and Linking Code for Relocation

- Linker scripts, sections...

## Relocating on Boot

## Life After Cartridges

- No reading ROM
