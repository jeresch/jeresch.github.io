Welcome to my site.
It's likely I won't give it too much love, but we'll see!
Thanks for reading, and I hope you find some posts interesting.

## Professional

I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2018 from The University of Chicago.

After graduating, I spent two years on a team developing a green-field trading engine (for market-making options).
This trading engine was developed alongside a powerful C++ framework for high-performance applications.
In my time on this team, I worked on both the domain-agnostic framework as well as some very market microstructure-aware functionality.

I'm currently (until July 2021) on gardening leave before starting a new job at a quantitative trading fund in a large hedge fund.
In that new role, I expect to be contributing to algorithmic execution software, in order to optimally execute large orders while minimizing market impact.

## Interests

I am particularly interested in several Computer Science topics, as well as some topics related to modern markets.
I will be diving deeper into some of these topics in this blog, but I'll mention some of these topics here.

### Programming Languages

- Performance vs ease of use
- Ergonomics
- Governance
- Rust
- C & C++
- Go
- Python
- Javascript
- DWARF debug info format

### Compilers

- Clang
- assembly sucks
- portability
- undefined behavior
- RISC vs CISC

### Operating Systems

- VM and MMU
- Linux
  - eBPF
  - Networking stack
  - Virtual file system as user-space interface
  - Syscalls as user-space interface
  - _start
- Filesystems
  - FAT
  - EXT
  - BTRFS
  - Tagged/semantic vs hierarchical
  - COW
  - Snapshots

### Computer Architecture

- RISC vs CISC
- Memory model
- Embedded environments

### C++

- Messy w/ backwards compatibility
- Powerful typed macro system (templates)
- Compile-time programming (not useful?)
  - Circle PL
  - Obfuscation
  - Compiler build-time overhead

### Market Microstructure

- Arbitrage techniques
- FIX protocol and optimizations
- Order types
- Idiosyncratic exchange qualities

## Hobbies

I try to spend most of my free time on productive pursuits
